## üìä Overview
This project analyzes US baby names data using SQL queries. It provides comprehensive analysis of baby naming trends over time, including popularity rankings, gender distribution, and historical patterns.

## üóÇ Project Structure
- `babynames.sql`: Main SQL file containing analysis queries
- `names_data.csv`: Raw data file containing baby names information
- `Babynames.xlsx`: Excel version of the analysis for easy viewing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. SQL Server Database Management System
2. CSV file viewer 
3. Basic SQL knowledge

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/us-baby-names-analysis.git
```

2. Create a new SQL Server database
3. Import the `names_data.csv` file into your database
4. Run the queries from `babynames.sql`

### Viewing Results
- View query results directly in your SQL Server interface
- Export results to Excel for additional analysis
- Use data visualization tools for creating charts and graphs
